/**
 * This component is quite hacky way how to show the same visuals as in alternative-upload-queue.
 *
 *  There is nothing common between {RegisteredApplication} entity and {FileItem} used in upload queue,
 *   so no common component between these 2 could simply exist.
 *
 *  There are several possible (more or less hacky) ways how to solve that:
 *
 *   *1) Kind of duplicate what we have in upload queue in other component for existing applications list
 *       This is the approach I choose, since it felt like the simplest one.
 *   2) Have completely generic "parent" queue component with 2 childs - upload queue and existing applications list.
 *      This generic parent component wouldn't really be nice and it wouldn't be easy to modify it for both use cases.
 *   3) Kind of convert RegisteredApplication and FileItem entities into some common entity and have one component
 *      to handle it. This is not really nice, because for file upload we need more data which are not available
 *      in registered application.
 *   4) Have one component which would handle 2 things: RegisteredApplications and upload queue. Lot of code would be duplicated
 *     (or *ngIf would be heavily used there)
